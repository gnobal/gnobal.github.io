					<description><![CDATA[I wanted to start using the service.
Just started filling out the details for a new account that I saw that the details fillings is not secured, nor does the login itself.
Kind of a surprise...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good point about the burning. Syncing is also nice, but somehow 10$ a month sounds expensive. I guess i need to get used to the idea. Besides, when u stop paying the data is gone i guess..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I know it&#039;s cheaper, with the HD solution everything is gone if the house burns down. And also you don&#039;t get the automatics syncing to all computers, which I really like. Imagine all your pictures available on any of your computers, including the latest changes.

I have stuff scattered across 3 computers and I didn&#039;t even mention my Windows virtual machine that contains my old computer. It&#039;s all a big mess and I hope this will help me clear it up. If it doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s easy to stop the subscription... I thought about this too - it&#039;s not as sticky as deduplicaion :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I recently started thinking about backup too (wedding pics ;)). It looks like external HD (or even two of those) which will be plugged in once a week for backup and unplugged is a cheaper solution, 300GB is about 100$.]]></description>
