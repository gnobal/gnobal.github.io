					<description><![CDATA[The dongle costs 30 pounds (it&#039;s locked to the provider, but you can unlock it for a small fee with some software, as far as I can tell.) Then you buy a plan. I got a 15 pounds plan that gives me 100 hours of connection a month or 3GB traffic. Considering that I&#039;m here for 21 days it should be enough (I&#039;m with a network called 3 - http://www.three.co.uk)/

On T-mobile they offered me a plan where you pay 2 pounds for 24 hours, so if you connect you pay 2 pounds and get free access for the next 24 hours. Then you don&#039;t pay anything until you connect again. So the plans vary.]]></description>
