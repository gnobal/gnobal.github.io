					<description><![CDATA[100,000... that&#039;s before MS bought them :)
(the kids today don&#039;t even know that part of history)

I remember a friend coming over to show me how to get on IRC in the university and talk to other people. In Israel the word &quot;mirc&quot; is often used as a substitute for the word IRC because mIRC was the most popular client :)

I remember playing Descent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_(computer_game) ) over the network (not the Internet) when I worked for a video game company. That was cool! And my buddy from work was a  very famous BBS owner nicknamed RadioGlow (I don&#039;t remember his real name)

Not only I&#039;m a dinosaur. I&#039;m a geeky one as well :S]]></description>
