					<description><![CDATA[I think the term girls is more common today, but it may just be an error on my side.

I understand what you mean about hiding feelings and lack of intimacy. You can say it took me a while, but I&#039;ve learned that lesson well.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Girls or women?

It is an ongoing challange to create intimacy.

I am sure that when you will be ready to be with a woman and build with her a long relation - you will be honest with her, tell her your feelings, and create intimacy, even with the risk of denial/rejection.  

My experience is  that if I hide my feelings, there is no room for intimacy. It is true for all kinds of relationship. Pepple can feel if I am intimate with them. Some kind of intuition or sense, I guess.

It enables what we call sometimes &quot;chemistry&quot;]]></description>
