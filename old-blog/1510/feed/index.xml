					<description><![CDATA[You pay if you share your feelings, you pay if you don&#039;t.
The only question is - where do you pay more? 


As for me: I think I pay more for not sharing.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot for the comment, kila.

I understand what you mean about anger in relationships. I think I know how to apologize when an apology is in place. It does take me some time to understand my mistakes, though. It may seem like I don&#039;t care, but when I&#039;m angry I always think I&#039;m right so I should cool off first.

Since I know you pretty well and also your wife, I know you two are good, kind, convenient people so it doesn&#039;t surprise me that your desire to stay close eventually overcomes your anger.

That friend and I are close, but not close enough for me to accept her behavior, even a few days later when I&#039;m less upset. The problem is I honestly don&#039;t feel like talking to her again, fearing that I will encounter more anger.

Obviously I&#039;m at a time where I&#039;m rethinking parts of my life. I&#039;m making some changes and this is just one of them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How close are you to each other?
(what is close actually???)
I&#039;m asking that, because:
If you&#039;re close to someone and its mutual, you&#039;re a lot open to each other&#039;s pitfalls and feedback.
It&#039;s part of friendship.
But it can have a downside.
We care a lot more and give more emphasis to friends interaction.
So if a friend offends us, our reaction can be very hard, because we expect him to know us and know our pitfalls, and present things from a deep and true knowing.

I sometimes get angry @ my wife but always cool off (eventually), after she understands and apologises and I blow up the &quot;angry balloon&quot;.
I want us to stay close.

It is very human to feel angry and get offended.
It is part of how relationships get stronger or weaker.

Times like these make you think about your relationships.]]></description>
