					<description><![CDATA[Basically the sales manager at the shop confirmed what most people say - that a dedicated stereo is better than a home theater receiver. He also said I should hear shelf speakers (not just floor speakers) because he thinks at the price range I&#039;m looking for they&#039;d give better sound.

He also explained the different kind of sounds you get from speakers - front stage and backstage for example and reassured me I&#039;ll know the difference once I get to listen to proper speakers (I told him I wasn&#039;t sure I have an ear for these things)]]></description>
