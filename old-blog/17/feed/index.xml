					<description><![CDATA[So I see that after telling me that you are out of topics you decided to write a section about every week you spent in the army. This will get you 150 parts... cool ;-)

I hope that in section 17 you will mention how we met in Jalame and that you become in charge of the base computer system (x86 with capabilities of a sinclair spectrum and a printer I brought from home).

Is this the place to write Fuck Yossi Yifrach? (If not, I will be happy to write it again in a future section.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Well, sadly I have to say that you aren&#039;t the only one who&#039;s been in the army prison, I&#039;ve been to &quot;Kelle 6&quot; and &quot;Kelle 4&quot; just to have the army take me of the course list (so they would stop sending me to army courses).
In &quot;Kelle 6&quot; we would march for hours and hours sometimes 8 hours straight.
So I say scre$ the army for not letting us do what we wanted to do.
Waiting for part 2.]]></description>
