					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve started looking, but in general I would like to pay much much less than that. I&#039;m looking for used phones on eBay, but there have been rumors that existing Google phone won&#039;t be able to receive OS updates after 1.5 (aka Cupcake), which would suck for me as a developer.

I&#039;m basically waiting for a friend of mine at work to buy an HTC G1 and maybe try my app on his phone. In any case it will take a while because even for this small app there&#039;s still much to do. Luckily the emulator provides a complete environment for application developers that don&#039;t go into the low level capabilities of the phone.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I want to buy an android as well.

I heard that HTC produces easy breakable phones, so paying ~2500 NIS for phone which can break after few months is a bummer.

In the US you can buy one with a 2 year warranty, which costs a bit more but I think is worth it.

It is also a bummer paying 2500+ for a phone, where, for the same price, you can buy a whole computer - LCD screen included.

So, when r u going 2 buy one and which?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[:) Unfortunately there isn&#039;t much to see in terms of GUI - it&#039;s mostly preferences. But I guess most non-graphics apps are like that.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks. I didn&#039;t know about the option to buy a dev phone. From from what I can tell:
1. It&#039;s not available in Israel.
2. For applications the emulator is good enough, I believe. The dev phone appears to be for people who want to do stuff like replace the system image.

Still... now I want one... should be fun to mess with it :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Great that you already have something working.

There is an option to buy a developer phone:
http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html#dev-phone-1

I heard that you can&#039;t use it for downloading application from the market (Perhaps just need to use a new account?)

Good luck.]]></description>
