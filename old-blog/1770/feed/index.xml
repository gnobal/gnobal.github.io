					<description><![CDATA[The user indeed needs to start and stop each profile on his/her own. The general idea that instead of setting your phone to silent or vibrate-only you use Dindy as a &quot;smarter&quot; silent mode.

Your ideas to use location-awareness for settings are very good and actually implemented in the highly-rated and free application Locale. It would be nice to integrate with Locale, since it does its job already very well. I&#039;ll put it on my TODO list to check whether this is possible or if the developers of Locale would expose such an interface to other applications.

As for car settings, that&#039;s also a good idea which I&#039;ve looked into. In fact, Android 2.0 contains the ability to detect that the phone is connected to a car adapter and I wanted to use that without breaking compatibility with Android 1.5 and 1.6.

I don&#039;t know if and when I&#039;ll get to implementing these features but these are very good suggestions so thanks a lot!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amit,

How do you detect that the person is in a meeting/car? Does the user need to change the state?
What about integration with GPS? You could move to a meeting state if the GPS coordinates is inside the meeting rooms.
You could also detect Car mode if the phone is moving more than a few KPH.
What do you think?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Alik, thanks a lot for the input. And here are my answers:
1. The Google market is about to get closer to the iPhone app store in the next version:
http://gizmodo.com/5352346/android-market-16-update-finally-brings-app-screenshots

2. Actually, Nokia&#039;s solution is a simplistic one. In reality there are free SMS responders that let you do automatic SMS responds even for Android. Dindy&#039;s strength is in letting the caller decide whether something is urgent or not, and this is also its defining feature (by the way, you can still use Dindy as a &quot;simple&quot; auto-responder as well... see example in answer #4.) Automatic SMS responders can&#039;t help you when you&#039;re sleeping, for example.

3. The issue of whitelists/blacklists has been brought up before. In general, I didn&#039;t see a way of adding them without making the interface much more complicated. But I also don&#039;t think they&#039;re really needed.
As for whitelists I think they completely miss the point of Dindy. The only overhead introduced to callers is having to call twice. Having a caller defined as &quot;always urgent&quot; seems very &quot;Israeli&quot; in nature to me. Only here do we &quot;plan for disasters&quot; by being available 100% of the time on our mobile phones.
And blacklists... don&#039;t get me started on those. If you have someone that will always call twice because he/she thinks it&#039;s urgent, I&#039;m sorry to disappoint you but you have a different problem that isn&#039;t related to mobile applications. As a friend of mine put it: &quot;Dindy will not help the user solve personal relations issues&quot; :)

4. People like Itai can always set Dindy to vibrate on both first and second call, essentially making Dindy a &quot;simple&quot; auto responder (as I mentioned before)

5. Releasing a free version is a good idea if sales are really slow, as they probably would be. There are quite a few ways to cripple Dindy, even though it&#039;s a very simple app.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding the too few paid locations.
What about releasing part of the app as a free one and sell the complete one - just like one of the open source pricing models.

This will help you get to all the available countries. The begining is the tough one and you need a crowd.
Also, it will perhaps give you a good reputation for good products and the next one will be much easier to sell (I know - better sell the first one, so it&#039;s just an idea).

Example:
Only paid customers will be able to configure the returned SMS message.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Balmer is such a caricature. How did he became a CEO?

Anyway, I talked to a friend and he said that the Android market place is more degenerated than the iphone app store.
He says that it is very hard to push a product through Android&#039;s market place.
iphone app store has a sophisticated pushing mechanism based on rating and response.

Another friend said that the idea is a bit problematic.
He said that Nokia already has a feature that upon an incoming call, if you decide not to answer, nokia creates a template SMS for to be sent to the calling number.
The process is manual where as Dindy&#039;s is automatic, but they address the same prblem.

What about specific numbers that you never want to miss, like the wife (driving on a highway and wants directions:) or Mom?
If you need to configure specific numbers to bypass Dindy&#039;s mechanism, than the solution becomes much more complicated, where as users love simplicity.

This takes me to personal characteristics.
Dindy is great for me. If i&#039;m in a meeting and the phone vibrates, my ears automatically gets shut from the meeting and I sometimes miss little though important pieces from the meeting. I don&#039;t won&#039;t any interruptions - unless urgent.
Itai, on the other hand, can do tons of things simultaneously, so perhaps he prefers to always see the incoming calls, silence them, write a response to the wife and still not miss a single word from the meeting.

How many people are there out there that are more like me?

Perhaps I&#039;m missing something...

Amit, hope that doesn&#039;t take the wind out of your sales - I sure could use Dindy.]]></description>
