					<description><![CDATA[The thing is that it took me time to get to these rules. I used to be a &quot;perfect design&quot; zealot and had a hard time compromising on code. But now you can pass by me almost anything as long as it works well and doesn&#039;t interfere with known (!) future enhancements. In the past hearing someone say something like I just did would probably make me hate him :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[From my limited experience:

Given enough time and momentum, many of the open-source software packages tend to gravitate towards compliance with these two rules, with the (sometimes painfully obvious) exception of &quot;shipping on time&quot;.

Commercial software rarely fully complies with any of these rules. Early versions rarely make the users very happy, and older versions, while succeeding in making the user happy most of the time, rarely have any significant amount of &quot;clean code&quot; in them.

So you are not alone, and you probably would be if you could do this...]]></description>
