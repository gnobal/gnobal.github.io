					<description><![CDATA[Here is another one: if you have a playlist which you want to add somewhere (e.g., quicklist), or simply delete, then you can only pick 20 at a time and there is no option to pick *all*.

Maybe we should write our own videotube and design it much better. Then we could share it with our friends, and they would share it to theirs. And then we could put in advertisements, you know, just to cover the financial burden, nothing more.
