					<description><![CDATA[There are forums, where I already advertised Dindy. Not aggressively, though.

Giving away a second related app is something I though of doing. I actually had an app ready but I was afraid that second app would be misunderstood as well and will end up hurting Dindy&#039;s sales. I guess I should have created a simple quality second app, such as an alarm clock or something like that.

Thanks.]]></description>
