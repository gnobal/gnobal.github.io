					<description><![CDATA[The CAN protocols is an interesting possibility. I&#039;ll look into it.

As for a universal remote... I looked into universal IR remote and turns out it&#039;s very complicated because of the different IR protocols by different manufacturers. It&#039;s hard to get right and the signal processing code is more than I can handle (but people have done it already.)

I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll find something to do :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If you can get it to speak your car&#039;s CAN protocols you can probably do some neat and semi-useful tricks (a remote that turns on the engine and air-conditioning from the office would be nice, although perhaps more than most cars can currently do via their CAN implementations without further hacking which would definitely void your warranty).

Also, the world of home audio-video is full of things that although others have indeed already done, are ridiculously easy and outrageously expensive. e.g. If you can get a decent RF universal remote without donating a kidney - let me know.]]></description>
