					<description><![CDATA[Your idea is a good one and was actually offered by a security researcher ( http://it.slashdot.org/story/10/11/10/0355231/Sophos-Researcher-Suggests-Password-Free-to-Spur-Wi-Fi-Encryption ) - he offered that all publicly-available networks should be encrypted and with the password &quot;free.&quot;

Unfortunately, though, I think I&#039;ll leave my network encrypted (with a secret password) because of my new venture after quitting IBM - it&#039;s just safer not to let anyone in instead of trying to enforce security with firewall rules like I used to.

One thing I don&#039;t understand is why WiFi network encryption is related to the network password. I mean - it should have been possible to enable encryption without requiring a password. Or am I missing something? 

Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not an expert on WiFi security, but I&#039;m pretty certain that if you use WPA or WPA2, set your password to something like X, and your SSID to something like FREE-ACCESS-Password-is-X, you get the best of both world: Nobody can sniff your packets and your WiFi is still effectively free for all.

I do have two warnings though: 1. I&#039;m not at all sure about this. Somebody will have to actually read the WPA specs to make sure it&#039;s true, and I&#039;m certainly not going to do this now. 2. One of the most common security best practices is not to open anything you don&#039;t need, so you did make the right choice in this regard anyway (unless you want to use public-access as a defense for some illegal on-line activities. The &quot;Somebody else did it&quot; excuse seems to work well in some countries).]]></description>
