					<description><![CDATA[I agree that by giving away information you can get some benefits like better search results, better connectivity with others and so on. And while you&#039;re a law abiding citizen you&#039;re thinking &quot;I have nothing to hide.&quot;

But the problem with giving your private information is that if at some point someone makes bad use of it you have no way to turn back and say &quot;I don&#039;t agree with this use of my information.&quot; At that point you might even have to move to a new address, change your phone number or even, as Eric Schmidt suggested, change your name ( http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/7951269/Young-will-have-to-change-names-to-escape-cyber-past-warns-Googles-Eric-Schmidt.html ).

As a person who shares a lot of information here on this blog, I might be a good candidate for a future name change. And that makes me worry.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yep, totally agree.
But, now that everyone&#039;s on facebook, it has become the defacto identity platform.
Youngsters don&#039;t even have email.

The old days are gone.
If you change your address or phone number, you don&#039;t need to send an email to everyone with the new details and consequently every friend needs to update your details on his address book.
With the new approach, his address book will be updated automatically with your new phone number when you update yours.

I agree that facebook is not really concerned with privacy and they&#039;re checking the bouderies all the time, and it&#039;s good that you published this. Facebook listened to you and others protesting.

But still, not give any information is like banning them.

I&#039;m also concerned with privacy, but thought of just seeing if giving my private details ricochets. Nothing so far...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All true, but phone number and address were always off limits. This is a kind of a &quot;blame the user&quot; model. All you wanted was to play some game and in the process you clicked an OK button which said something about sharing your contact information. Now you get spammed by junk text messages and obviously it&#039;s your fault because you wanted to play a game.

I had my contact info removed and disabled all Facebook applications a long time ago. I&#039;m glad I did.]]></description>
