					<description><![CDATA[So now you know what to get for my next birthday...

I think it is “mekutzar”. As I recall “mekutzrar&quot; has less plastic, but maybe someone who didn&#039;t use his wepon as a paper weight can clear this issue.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow... this _is_ cool. The nitro gas powered RC boat is extremely a guy toy ;)

By the way, is this a &quot;mekutzar&quot; or &quot;mekutzrar&quot;? And don&#039;t insult me with laser sights. These are for pussies :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The RC shark is realy cool so I looked for its price. Anyway, I got to this store which sells many cools things, among them RC boats, RC cars and guns. So I was wondering, since as I recall you never had the short version, would you like one:

http://www.jprtrading.com/shop/product_info.php/cPath/74_77/products_id/443

There is another version w/ a laser sight for an extra $5 ;-)

Check out the Nitro Gas RC boats - there is a special reservoir in the park where people bring their own sail-boats, and I was thinking how fun it will be to rock the water with a 60mph Nitro Gas boat.]]></description>
