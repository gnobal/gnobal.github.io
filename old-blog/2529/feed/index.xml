					<description><![CDATA[Hehe... well, I guess you&#039;re right. The carbon footprint of an interpreted language programmer is much smaller. But you should really take a look at the new C++. It&#039;s awesome... like a new toy to play with :)

And, of course, it was a joke. Just something I thought about when I realized the software I&#039;m currently writing could have been written much faster in some scripting language :S]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[ok, ill pick up the glove, and what if the time needed to write a code in an interpreted language is 10% of the time needed to do so in a compiler based language? what about the resources the programmer may waste while coding?(food, electricity, water, other people&#039;s sanity etc...)
interpreted languages are greener then anything else!]]></description>
