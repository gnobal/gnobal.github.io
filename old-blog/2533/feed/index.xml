					<description><![CDATA[The Unity &quot;PLUGIN&quot;


is a bunch of cart load of....!!  The Default setting is Dodge-window for the sidebar (when a window conflicts with it for screen-space then it autohides. 


JUST to change it to &quot;always autohide&quot;, you need to install a completely crappy (Ubuntu style) settings manager, 98% of which is uniintelligible to any simple first time Ubuntu user..basically a non computer graphics individual, and then you can adjust the settings of the Unity plugin and &quot;God almighty would have a touch time figuring out&quot;, what else.

Hopeless-fully

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the replay.
Most probably I&#039;m not more advanced, but we use different functions:)
For example, it&#039;s the first time I hear about Windows + number to start or switch applications. 
Thanks for the info.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re a more advanced user than I am. Some of these issues you mentioned (e.g. using the Windows key as compose, workspaces) I&#039;ve never done (I come from a Windows background.) For me using the Windows key to pop up the Ubuntu menu and then starting to type a name of a program is something I&#039;m used to from Windows 7 (I hardly ever click the menus from the &quot;All Applications&quot; thing)

I do like the fact that I have more room for my maximized windows, especially when I&#039;m programming. But you&#039;re right that it comes at the cost of having to remember more context than before, like which programs are open. I&#039;m trying to organize my most-used applications in the launcher the way I do in Windows 7 so that I can use Windows key+1, Windows key+2, etc. to launch or switch between applications.

The new scrollbars - I still haven&#039;t formed a strong opinion on the matter. I guess I don&#039;t mind the change so much because I haven&#039;t been using the scrollbars, but mostly the mouse wheel or the keyboard.

There&#039;s a lack of consistency which is troubling, but I&#039;m guessing that will be improved over time. Also, there are some really annoying bugs like audio in Flash that keeps getting messed up.

After two days of using the new interface, it has somewhat grown on me and I care less about it but maybe it&#039;s because I get more annoyed by the aforementioned bugs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Had same problem:)
I think in my case it was caused by copying text and pictures from firefox to Office Word. After I closed Word, launcher was hiding again.
I also thought I&#039;m getting old because I&#039;m less enthusiast about changes in software interface:) Might be true as long as I have less patience in learning how things work.
But I fail to see the benefits of the new interface. It expands screen for the application, but many programs already have &quot;Full Screen&quot; view.
Here are some regrets:
   I think the task-bar on the bottom of the screen was very important. Now I have to remember what programs I opened.(it&#039;s particularly uncomfortable when I have minimized application on different workspaces)
   The old menu was great. I only had to click on Applications-&#062; (sub-menu)-&#062; (chosen program). Now it&#039;s much more complicated; Have to click on &quot;+&quot; from the launch, than click on All Applications, than select sub-menu, than click on &quot;show x more installed&quot;, than click on application...
   They removed the weather applet from the top panel, but that&#039;s less important.
   They made scrollbars auto-hide, which is quite confusing.
   I was using Windows button as Compose-key. It seems it&#039;s no longer an option as it&#039;s used for Menu. But I found using Caps-Lock as Compose key is better.

I wonder if new Ubuntu users find this new interface easier/better than the previous. It might be if they are used with iPads.]]></description>
