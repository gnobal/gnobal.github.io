					<description><![CDATA[udim: Google+ app? Sounds like a good idea. But do you think it will solve the following? Let&#039;s say you have two groups of circles - those you share your stuff with and those you don&#039;t. If you add a circle in the future - to which group will it belong? Because I might want the people in the new circle to see my previous posts. Will an app be able to dynamically share (or not share) historical posts with new circles?

Albert: But what if I want to follow someone without him being able to see my previous posts (aimed at &quot;My Circles&quot;) that were not meant for him? I can&#039;t, because he can now go into my profile and see everything. Also, now for every post I have to pick specific circles and I can never use the special groups &quot;Your Circles&quot; or &quot;Your Extended Circles&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[If some is in your &#039;following&#039; circle, but you&#039;re not in his, he will not see your post on his stream. He will see it in the incoming. The incoming is a different ball game.

					<description><![CDATA[(Second try)
You have two options: 
1. Wait for Google to implement the feature you want.
2. Write your own Google+ app that generates circles using rules, such as: &quot;all my circles minus the assholes.&quot; :)]]></description>
