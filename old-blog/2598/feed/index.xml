					<description><![CDATA[Running is the only thing I managed to stick to, and at 35 I still have at least 20 years of it ahead of me... then I might switch. For now all the doctors say I&#039;m fine and that I should rest and let it go away, which seems to be helping.

I just hope to be back to running in 2-3 weeks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good you will see a physician, this can&#039;t be wrong. Than take desicions. 
How about some swimming? I think that the best is to mix. Running is usually not a solution for.. iternity..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Unfortunately I run on uneven asphalt pavements mostly.

I went to see some doctors and nothing seems to be wrong with me so far. Might be just an infection that isn&#039;t related to muscle or bone. Rest seems to help for now, so I&#039;m resting (following the advice of one of the doctors)

We&#039;ll see what I&#039;ll do when I&#039;m back to working out. I&#039;ve started considering going back to the gym for something other than running, but I prefer to go back to my routine.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think I already mentioned this, but you could try other aerobic exercises, like rowing.

BTW, are you running on hard surfaces like pavements or softer ones like grass?]]></description>
