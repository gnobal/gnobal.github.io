					<description><![CDATA[They have a few ways to verify that you are real here. 
Some are based on your bank account. They might ask you to transfer one cent to a pay-pal account or something similar.
Another way might be by verifying your address via snail mail. FYI: in Germany you have to register with the local authorities within 3 weeks of moving to a new residence.

OK, you get the idea: hard evidence is needed.]]></description>

How about using your 20% for that? :)

					<description><![CDATA[How about a sponsor?
I may be wrong, but I think you can&#039;t open a bank account without a letter of employment or a related account (such as a family member).
So you might ask someone to bootstrap your online identity by vouching for you.]]></description>
