					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot!

It&#039;s great to know that https for custom domains is on the way. I wish Google would say about their upcoming products _when_ they will be available. For example, that post you sent me to is nearly 4 months old. When they wrote it, did you expect it to take 4 months to become available (considering that they started testing it at the time?)

I already have the feature request about DKIM starred :) But now that I have a solid implementation with Amazon SES and task queues, it&#039;s low on my priority list.

Thanks again]]></description>
