					<description><![CDATA[Hi there...
It took me some time to figure out that &#039;send to email&#039; is not my password, but it is not my fault that it was never sent to me. So now that I can comment I can tell you how pissed I am that there is not link to my site (http://homepages.nyu.edu/~ac1058/) under Friends and Family (btw, nice site Revital). 
Anyway congradulations! It&#039;s a cool site and it&#039;s great that you have something to do with &#039;gnobal&#039; - I just hope you are not going to write too much about programming, since besides providing us with a profession, it sucks! 
OK I&#039;ll see you in two seconds on the MSN...]]></description>
