					<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s a good question. Definitely build something simpler and show it to people earlier. Maybe look for an integration opportunity with other services (e.g. go to someone like WhatsApp and see if they want a gaming infrastructure).

For example, Playrock could have been a simple &quot;play with people around you&quot; type of service in the beginning. No groups, no sign in, nothing else.

From a technical point of view, I could have built a simpler server-side. Writing it in a more forgiving language (Java or C#) would have probably made life easier and allowed for faster development. And later it could still be replaced with a C++ alternative later, if needed (the protocol was protobuf).]]></description>
