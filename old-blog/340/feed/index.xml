					<description><![CDATA[&quot;pretty much&quot;??? Just to give you an analogy with something that you are familiar with: saying that Dijkstra *was pretty much right about* something in CS, is like saying that Stroustrup pretty much knows how to program...

					<description><![CDATA[1. I didn&#039;t know that. Anyway, her was pretty much right about goto as well.
2. It&#039;s funny that you mentioned recursions because that&#039;s abother thing that is not allowed in production code in many companies (again, this is true for every company I worked for)
3. The fact that you wrote Exception with a capital E exposes you ;)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[1. As a side remark, Dijkstra had many important papers, and he was a pioneer in concurrent systems (not only algorithms for shortest path...).
2. Your thumb rule works only when there are no recursions, from any kind.
3. What is an Exception? :)]]></description>
