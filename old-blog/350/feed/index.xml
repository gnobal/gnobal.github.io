					<description><![CDATA[True, my mistake was that I did actually repeat the subject in the email body itself, which I shouldn&#039;t have.

And those &quot;hi&quot; emails contained sometimes stuff that was not even related to &quot;hi&quot;. Oh, and I still have them :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The example in the link is very subjective - of course that in such a situation it is better to sum the whole email in the subject. 

Few years ago I used to get emails with a really long subject that made no point for also having a body to the email. Gush, I should have kept them, you would have laughed your guts out.  

Anyway, did those emails with &#039;hi&#039; as a subject used to contain something like &#039;Hi, How are you doing? What&#039;s new?&#039; as a body? Cause, in my opinion, that would have made the subject just right. Or maybe he just saved energy because he knew that one day you would be able to search your emails for content very easily.]]></description>
