					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t understand why you are worried about websites that are given money according to popularity. 

I think that most of them fail to survive the cents-per-user model, while the founders of those that succeed sometimes worry about completely different things. Like what type of bed they should have in their corporate air-plane.

So when you say bubble what do you mean? Do you think that at present investors are looking for cents-per-user ideas rather than selling-product-based start-ups? (I don&#039;t think so...) And do you worry about it because you think that the stock market will fall or because you have an idea to come-up with such a web site? (I hope not...)

So I agree with Mr. Graham. You can be sure that once you&#039;ll have a good product you&#039;ll find many MBAs who would make a business plan for you.]]></description>
