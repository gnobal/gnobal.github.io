					<description><![CDATA[&quot;being called the uggs of summer is not a compliment&quot;, that&#039;s funny. Of course Sharon has the uggs as well but for her defend I must say that she doesn&#039;t like them nor the crocs very much, and I am the one who them for her. bummer that they don&#039;t have the shirt in s. Anyway when I bought crocs, about two years ago, I thought they looked very cool. Here they are popular to some degree but I heard that everyone in Israel has them. bummer-2.

Does Junior=women in Canada?]]></description>
