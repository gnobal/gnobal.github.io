					<description><![CDATA[There are different learning styles . There are people who are more cognitive, and than they have to understand, it is a must for them.  For wxample: there are people who are more experiential. They must experience first and draw conclusions afterwards. And there are many more. I know for myself - I love to experience, and it takes me more time if I have to get it only in a cognitive way.
Remeber, when a baby learns to walk - there is no theory or understanding first. It is trial. Nobody gave him a lecture about it. And there is a lot of imitation too. 
There is a saying in Hebrew: &quot;Hanoch lanar al pi darko&quot;. They were clever, the old scholars!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When you were a kid, did other kids used to slap you on the back of your neck? Cause if you were next to me right now, I would have slapped you, for sure. 

I am sure that all readers who know you personally would agree that you tend/agree/happy to help others more than any other person. And the blame should be on *us* when we keep asking the same *programming* questions again and again. My proof - the makefile is working now.

And you know what, now I think  that maybe this is your tactic to get *us* stop asking you all of these annoying programming questions, by feeling sorry that not only that we waste your time but also that after all you feel bad about it. Isn’t it? So this is not going to work for you!! I&#039;m going to compose an arsenal of dumb question which I will ask you from time to time. Of course I will repeat the same questions occasionally. And if you ever going to tell me that you are sorry for not providing me with a good-enough-answer, I will leave a Hebrew comment on your blog!]]></description>
