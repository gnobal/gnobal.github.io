					<description><![CDATA[I also wanted to say the same when I clicked the response button: You have already made A Change&#039; and a significant one. I Don&#039;t know about &quot;The Change&quot; you&#039;re talking about. We both have the same flaw: We ask too much of ourselves, criticize ourselves too much and not appreciating enough what we have acomplished.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think you have already &quot;made the change&quot; both physically and mentally. I don&#039;t think there are many of us out there that would get up EVERY morning as early as you no matter what and go work out. I mean come on... we need to sleep at least till 7 am, don&#039;t we? (I know I do, I need my beauty sleep).]]></description>
