					<description><![CDATA[Hey there!
It&#039;s a great review. You&#039;re more lucky than you think, because that was very special show for prodigy. The were looking especially different on that show and played some &quot;never played again and never released&quot; tracks.
I&#039;m writing to you, because I want to know if anyone has any recordings from that show. Maybe you know some people who have recorded something?]]></description>
