					<description><![CDATA[I remember Arkanoid.
You mean it is your favorite because you finished it ?
I guess Wonder Boy has stayed my favorite because I didn&#039;t finish it for all those years... :)
When I was 25 I played it on MAME.
Anyway,
Arkanoid sucks
Wonder Boy rules]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Where did you play it when you were 25? Online?

Since I&#039;m a competitive person, I must say that my favorite childhood game was Arkanoid, since I finished it (until today I remember it had 33 levels. Last one was The Boss)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Guyz, 
My favorite old game is Wonder Boy (Sega Arcades, available on MAME). This was my favorite game since I was 10 years old, and it&#039;s the best game ever, and I didn&#039;t finish it until I was 25.

What&#039;s yours ?]]></description>
