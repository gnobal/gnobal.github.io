					<description><![CDATA[I know, because (unlike Windows) in Macintosh you usually don&#039;t maximize windows to the entire screen, and there&#039;s the dock and the menu is always on top so it&#039;s easier to get to. 
Maybe it&#039;s because I&#039;m already used to it, but I usually work with less than 5 windows open. And when I say &quot;work&quot; I mean that I mostly use one of them and the others I look at from time to time. So I guess I got used to Windows.
And as for your intention of buying a Mac, looks like you&#039;re not the only one. &quot;Apple&#039;s Macs at highest point ever on consumer ‘intent to purchase’ index&quot;: http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/macs_at_highest_point_ever_on_consumer_intent_to_purchase_index/]]></description>
