					<description><![CDATA[As far as I know, ink is only so costly for HP printers. Also, when a company has a large portion of the market, it&#039;s common to regulate its products&#039; prices (for example, by declaring it a monopoly). I don&#039;t think the EU investigated HP regarding their ink prices for no reason.
And by the way, HP printers come with half-full cartridges, which is another deceitful way to con consumers out of their money. You can read about a man that sued HP and lost here:

Also, by the way, ink costs more than human blood:
http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/peripherals/hp-ink-costs-more-than-human-blood-booze-212444.php

I would like to also note that I didn&#039;t only address printers in my post. HP has zero support here in Israel, and now I know why - they don&#039;t care about small markets. It&#039;s a good business decision, but if that&#039;s the case they are welcome to pull all their products out of the Israeli market and never bring them back, for all I care.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really skeptic about what this former employee says in #1, #2 is trivial for all companies, what is the big secret about the others?

I also disagree regarding the printers support (I don&#039;t know about their other products). It is well known that they, and other companies, make their profit from the ink and not from the printers themselves. Actually the printer price is relatively very cheap, and since printers themselves are a very sensitive product I assume that including support would have increased the price dramatically. I think that here people take for granted that printers should be replaced more often than desktops and just throw them away when they break. I never heard of someone who gave a printer to be fixed. That said, here you can return a product within 30 days even if you used it, so it gives you the option to test it or replace it if it breaks within that time frame. 

Do other companies give better support for printers? (I think that you see many complaints about HP because that what most people buy)]]></description>
