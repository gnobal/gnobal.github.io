					<description><![CDATA[Right... so I found the same 38$ price:
http://www.geekzone.co.nz/freitasm/2984
But that&#039;s distribution price. If you consider the distributer addition, the price is even higher.

But let&#039;s say the price is only 38$. Don&#039;t you think that&#039;s a lot for a simple (albeit special) screw?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you find a web site (with the screw&#039;s picture) where it is sold for that price? I could only find it for $38, with no picture of the screw and it actualy seems to be related with speakers and not ps3.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I realize that Microsoft tactics for consumer lock-in are awful, to say the least.
But:
1. I think Microsoft is getting better over time, and they will get better because market forces will make them get better
2. I can&#039;t honestly bash Microsoft while I&#039;m still using their products at home. Maybe when I&#039;ll make the switch :)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[rom: I have mixed feelings about Microsoft... as a monopoly they use business tactics that aren&#039;t friendly. But as a developer for Microsoft I felt as if they were doing good things so that you&#039;ll be able to relatively easily develop for the various versions of Windows. These things are somewhat related: if you set the standard you can also provide the best development tools.

xtreeq: Yep... that&#039;s a funny one.]]></description>
