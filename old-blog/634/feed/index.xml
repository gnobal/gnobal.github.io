					<description><![CDATA[I just installed Ubuntu. The installation itself is very easy.  Setting up the Internet connection with a cable modem in Israel was a bitch, though. It wasn&#039;t trivial, but luckily I got help from some forums (I&#039;ll probably tell about it in a different post).

Ubuntu seems to have a &quot;Hibernate&quot; option. I didn&#039;t try it yet, though. It also seems to have support for wireless connections, but I can&#039;t test that. I&#039;m surprised about the partition thing. However, my installation is Linux only (not dual-boot).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I heard lot&#039;s of good things about Ubuntu. I&#039;m currently pissed off with the Linux that I have (it is red hat though):
1. No wireless
2. No hibernate
3. It does not recognize a fat partition that I left especially for it to share files with Windows.
4. More sensitive for the processor temp (than windows) - my laptop actually crashed twice today for that reason. 

I guess all could be fixed but I have no time for this shit. Maybe I&#039;ll switch to Ubuntu as well -- after all you&#039;ll be familiar with the installation... :)]]></description>
