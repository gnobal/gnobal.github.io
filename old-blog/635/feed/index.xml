					<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re right. Unfortunately, the ISPs don&#039;t support the &quot;always online&quot; mode of the router (without the dialer) so if you use this you can&#039;t get support for it later.

In the US, who configures the router dialup? The user or the ISP? What happens if the user changes password?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I disagree with your comment &quot;expecting a home user to be constantly connected &quot;. In the US it is very obvious that this is the case. When I came here I was very surprised that I had to log in every time when using ADSL. But I found out that there is a way to hack the modem and turn it to be a router thus it always on. I think that bezeq don&#039;t give it as a default in order to make it harder for users to set a wireless connection at home, unless buying the router from bezeq.]]></description>
