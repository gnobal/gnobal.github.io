					<description><![CDATA[The &quot;IM Waiting&quot; idea is more of a social feature than a &quot;must-have&quot; feature. If you know that I am already in the middle of a conversation, then _you_ have to decide if you want to disturb me, instead of me having to decide to turn you down and explain why.

I sometimes feel uncomfertable turning down someone who is starting to talk to me, for example if it&#039;s been a long time since we last talked, or if it&#039;s someone that just doesn&#039;t understand IM and gets offended if I say &quot;I can&#039;t talk to you right now&quot;.

Also, a lot of people just start talking to me, especially if they have a short buddy list and don&#039;t realize what it&#039;s like to have a long buddy list.]]></description>
