					<description><![CDATA[Thanks a lot :)

I hope the trip to Alcatraz will not involve rain, but it might be OK even if it rains - I find it nicer to walk in the rain than I did in Israel. Maybe because I don&#039;t have a &quot;goal&quot; when I&#039;m just walking around and also because of my excellent coat that I got in New York.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[About walking in the rain: you have the freedom to walk (or not walk) in the rain. I think it is nice, if you know that you can reach a bath and take a good hot shower later.... 

You also remind me the story about &quot;The birdman from Alcatraz&quot; which was one of my bestsellers during my youth.

I never thought to visit there (which was a mistake)...

Have a good time!!!]]></description>
