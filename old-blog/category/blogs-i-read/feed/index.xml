					<description><![CDATA[I&#8217;ve written about Raymond Chen and his popular blog a few times before. He&#8217;s a brilliant Microsoft employee, who writes about &#8220;serious&#8221; stuff like how to use some of Windows&#8217; API, while also including nice stories from Microsoft&#8217;s past (plus some other stuff, which always shows how much you can learn from him). This time &#8230; <p class="link-more"><a href="/old-blog/534" class="more-link">Continue reading<span class="screen-reader-text"> "Interview With Raymond Chen (Audio)"</span></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve written about Raymond Chen and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/">his popular blog</a> a few times before. He&#8217;s a brilliant Microsoft employee, who writes about &#8220;serious&#8221; stuff like how to use some of Windows&#8217; API, while also including nice stories from Microsoft&#8217;s past (plus some other stuff, which always shows how much you can learn from him).</p>
<p>This time I&#8217;m writing about him because there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast56TheOldNewThingWithRaymondChen.aspx">a podcast</a> online where you can listen to him getting interviewed about the blog, his new book and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Did you know that every copy of Windows XP includes Microsoft Bob (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob">Wikipedia definition</a>)? I didn&#8217;t. If you have an original Windows CD and you can pound on your keyboard with your hand in a very specific way, you can get to the Microsoft Bob installation on the CD :)</p>
<p>I guess you have to listen to the podcast to know why I&#8217;m saying that.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Raymond Chen was interviewed previously on another show. It&#8217;s also very funny for Windows developers with a bit of sense of history. <a href="http://dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showID=214">Here it is</a>.</p>

I have a few of his books, the first of which I bought at a bus station, as preparation for a long trip. In addition to books, Dave also maintains <a href="http://blogs.herald.com/dave_barrys_blog/">a weblog</a>, which has daily links to funny stuff on the Internet (Dave Barry and his readers, who supply some of the links,  can find something funny in just about anything). </p>
<p>Dave used to write a <a href="http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/living/columnists/dave_barry/">weekly column</a> for The Miami Herald. Unfortunately, he took a vacation from writing the weekly column, but in the link you can find Dave Barry classics, which are still hilarious.</p>
