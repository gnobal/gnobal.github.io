										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I got myself an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and immediately went on to try the (simplest) &#8220;Blink&#8221; example. It was very cool to make the LED on the board blink, I admit. But then I went on to find out how to build stuff like a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yst4eL0-Eco">4x4x4 LED cube</a> or a (relatively) simple universal remote and I realized two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most of the stuff has already been created by others.</li>
<li>They already did it much better than I ever would.</li>
</ol>
<p>I realized that I&#8217;m not really into soldering and connecting wires. I&#8217;m more of a &#8220;high level&#8221; kind of guy &#8211; I like taking ready-made parts and creating new things with them, not mess with the low level stuff. It&#8217;s also true with software &#8211; while I enjoy seeing the possibilities of building useful libraries with a language just like the next guy, I still prefer using them over trying to write them.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m still looking for nice (and hopefully new) things to do with the Arduino that will either be fun or useful for me. I might even try some wiring :)</p>

On the HTC Hero (or Eris, depends on where you bought it) there isn&#8217;t apparently a way to edit this dictionary &#8211; only delete it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll repeat the advice I found <a href="http://www.htcwiki.com/thread/3373777/Deleting+words+from+the+dictionary">here</a>, presumably based on an HTC support request:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thank you for your questions about how to delete an entry in the dictionary. We are more than happy to help you with this situation. In order to clear out a misspelled word you accidentally saved you must clear out the entire dictionary. <strong>To clear the dictionary you press Menu then go to Settings &gt; Applications &gt; Manage Applications and find the “Touch Input” program. Tap on the Clear data button.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Having said that, it turns out that the issue is subject to <a href="http://www.scq.ubc.ca/the-social-norm-of-leaving-the-toilet-seat-down-a-game-theoretic-analysis/">actual research</a>. Not much research, but who would have thought?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wrote about advances in user interfaces a few times (<a href="/old-blog/333">here</a> and <a href="/old-blog/232">here</a>). Then I wrote about Apple&#8217;s iPhone (<a href="/old-blog/481">here</a>), which is coming out in less than a month in the US. All those posts have one thing in common &#8211; the user interfaces in them are multi-touch and gesture-based.</p>
<p>The new player in this field is Microsoft, which just introduced <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/">Surface</a>, a new multi-touch, interactive tabletop display. It interacts with available media sources and allows users to interact with it using their hands. The demo videos are, of course, amazing. One thing I thought was funny in the videos was when the handsome young man and woman sit in front of each other in a pub and then, naturally, start playing with the computer on both sides of the table.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, another stupid &#8220;gadget&#8221; that&#8217;s worth mentioning here. It&#8217;s actually an interesting idea, but the demonstration is horrible. So what is the Waterfryer? It&#8217;s a deep fryer that has water under the oil. The result of having the water there is that, since water and oil don&#8217;t mix, the oil stays clean because all the food crumbs fall into the water. The water stays clean, and to demonstrate this there&#8217;s a fish living there right under the very hot oil. I guess you have to see it to understand. Check out <a href="http://www.ohgizmo.com/2007/03/29/japanese-deep-fryer-has-aquarium-within/">this video</a>. (via <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a>)</p>
