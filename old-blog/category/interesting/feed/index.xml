Namely, unlike common perception, computer memory takes time to fade out after you turn the computer off. So much time, in fact, that you can read it and extract encryption keys from it to later unlock encrypted data. A very interesting research.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There has always been speculation that Google is developing a mobile phone (a gPhone, as most articles called it), but Google always does things differently. This time announcing the <a href="http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/">Open Handset Alliance</a>, which is a bunch of companies that develop an open, Linux-based hardware and software platform with an open API. The platform is called Android.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much to see yet (specifically, there isn&#8217;t any phone based on Android yet) but there are two nice short videos. One is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rYozIZOgDk">Introducing Android</a>, which shows the team that developed it (including Andy Rubin, who you can read about in this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/technology/04google.html">New York Times article</a>). The second video is called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWtFeIw8MVM">If I had a magic phone</a> where you can see cute kids telling us what they expect from a magic phone.</p>

Most of them are there because they need some kind of a follow-up, but I can&#8217;t deal with them right now or the action to be taken is in the future. Merlin Mann is a well known figure in the productivity and GTD (Getting Things Done) world (<a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann&#8217;s website</a>). Recently he gave a great talk at Google, called <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=973149761529535925">Inbox Zero</a>, which is the name of his system for handling very large amounts of email.</p>
<p>After watching the video and taking action I now have 21 items in my Inbox folder. Soon to be zero.</p>
